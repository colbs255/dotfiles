# TODO

- stow does not work with '~' need actual directory
- stow has a source directory (-d) which tells it where the stow packages are
- by default, stow will store in parent directory (e.g., when in ~/dotfiles, stow nvim will make a ~/.config/nvim...)
- and a target directory -t which tells it where to install the package
    - you need to specify the -t when deleting (-D) to tell it where to delete
